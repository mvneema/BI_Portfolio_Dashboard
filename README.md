## 🔍 Key Finding: Sales vs Profit Trade-off

While physical stores (**StoreType = Store**) generate the **highest Total Sales**, they contribute to **lower Total Profit**.

This suggests that high-revenue store locations may be impacted by:
- Higher operational and staffing costs  
- Aggressive discounting or promotions  
- Lower-margin product mix  

📌 **Business Implication:**  
There is a clear opportunity to **optimize profitability at high-performing physical stores** by refining pricing strategies, cost structures, and regional product mix — without sacrificing revenue.
